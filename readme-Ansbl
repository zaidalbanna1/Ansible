This is a collection of notes that helped me get Ansible going on osx el capitan

- Followed steps outlined in this link:

http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip

- After ansible download had to add the following to my environment:

ANSIBLE_HOSTS=/Users/zaid/Projects/Ansible/hosts

- Created file hosts in

/Users/zaid/Projects/Ansible

- The files looks like this:

[zaid-mbp:~/Projects/Ansible] zaid% cat hosts
mymac1 ansible_ssh_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_port=22 ansible_ssh_user=zaid ansible_ssh_pass=D1rW2ktJ08?!
##srx1 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.4.151 ansible_ssh_port=22 ansible_ssh_user=root  ansible_ssh_pass=R00tt00R

[local]
mymac1 

[host]
##srx1
